---
Every time I have attempted to build an online business without accountability, I failed. 

It always goes the same way - I create a grand strategy, I publish a few videos or write a few blog posts, some do well while others don't, I get demotivated, I stop posting. 

The few times I had told my friends to hold me accountable, it was better. However, those accountability checks stop at one point, and I am back to square one. 

Hence, this time I want to do it differently.

Instead of asking my wife or a friend to hold me accountable, I will openly set expectations with my audience and document my journey through weekly and monthly check-in updates. I will call these "accountability check-ins".
## Accountability Check-ins
So, what would be some of these checkpoints? 

I am still finalizing the details, but it will look something like this: 
1. Weekly blog post on [Medium](https://irtizahafiz.medium.com/?utm_source=peronal_blog)
2. Weekly video on [YouTube](https://irtizahafiz.medium.com/?utm_source=personal_blog)
3. Publicly available roadmap with upcoming content
4. Monthly recap of metrics, revenue and progress

In the past, I have consistently published at a weekly cadence. So, I am not worried about that. 

The two new changes that I am most excited about is the **[public roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktiFAef99gfBf3kHi5gDjBtEVTfS3jq5zcWScDnUegw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)** and **monthly recap.**

I hope these two changes will keep my audience more engaged throughout this journey.
## The Content
Now, let's talk about what domain I will focus on. 

In the past, I have discussed a wide array of topics - productivity, programming, management, minimalism, personal finance, software development, etc. 

After deep introspections, I came to the realization that my motivation goes away because I am not as passionate about some of these topics as I would like to think. 

The only topic that consistently comes back is **programming or software development.** I enjoy tinkering or building things through code, and sharing my learnings with others. 

So, that's what my content business will be about - **programming**. I will follow up with more details later on in the [content roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktiFAef99gfBf3kHi5gDjBtEVTfS3jq5zcWScDnUegw/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
## The Strategy 
At this point, you might be wondering - what's new about this? I have published videos or written about programming tutorials countless times before. How is it different now? 

This time, I want to be more methodical in my approach. 

Instead of blindly uploading whatever I feel like, I plan on being more surgical.

I consider myself a very analytical and nerdy person. So I hope an approach involving metrics and incentives will work better than setting up arbitrary goals. 

The strategy will revolve around 4 key components:
1. YouTube Channel - [Code with Irtiza](https://www.youtube.com/@irtizahafiz?utm_source=personal_blog)
2. Medium Account - [Irtiza Hafiz](https://irtizahafiz.medium.com/?utm_source=personal_blog)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com/irtiza07)
4. Digital Products
5. [Personal Website](https://irtizahafiz.com/?utm_source=personal_blog)

For every new topic that I learn or anything I build, the *content* will go through the following sequence: 
1. Build Phase - coding or learning about a topic
2. Digital Product - creating a companion notes PDF or downloadable digital content 
3. Writing - Publish a comprehensive Medium blog post 
4. Filming - Publish a YouTube video on the topics
5. Aggregating - Create a reference page on my personal website for each topic and their respective digital product, blog and video. 

Firstly, I hope the combination of this multimodal approach provides value to everyone, no matter your learning style. Secondly, I hope the digital products and GitHub code gives people something to take away from the time they spent watching or reading. 

Finally, I hope these components create a **flywheel effect** to quickly grow the business.
