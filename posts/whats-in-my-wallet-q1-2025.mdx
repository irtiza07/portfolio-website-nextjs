seoTitle: What’s in My Wallet Q1 2025? Best Credit Cards for Maximizing Rewards
seoDescription: Discover the best credit cards in my wallet for Q1 2025! From Chase Freedom Flex’s 9X grocery rewards to Fidelity Visa’s sign-up bonus and Bilt’s rent perks, learn how I’m optimizing credit card rewards and points this quarter.
---

Although I entered 2025 with the mindset of “no new credit cards”, some of the smaller sign-up-bonuses were too tempting to turn down. 

The goal this quarter is to hit the minimum spending requirement for 2 new credit cards (more on them below), while maximizing earning Chase Ultimate Rewards and Bilt points.

Let’s get started.

## Chase Freedom Flex

I still have 2 months left on the “5X Gas and Grocery for your first 12 months” new card bonus on my [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18J/12K8NPLW0F). 

Even better, one of the rotating 5X quarterly this quarter is Grocery. 

That means, I am essentially getting 9X on all my grocery purchases this quarter. That’s an opportunity I cannot miss\! 

So, I am putting all my gas and grocery spend on my [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18J/12K8NPLW0F) to earn Ultimate Rewards points.

## Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature

One of the new cards (and easily one of my newest favorites) I acquired recently is the Fid[elity Rewards Visa Signature](https://www.fidelity.com/spend-save/visa-signature-card) credit card. It’s an unlimited 2X no foreign transaction fee VISA card with a high credit limit. 

I will get a $150 bonus after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months. Quite easy\!

Until I hit the minimum spending requirement, I will put all my purchases (except grocery and gas) on [this card](https://www.fidelity.com/spend-save/visa-signature-card).

## American Express Blue Business Plus

Similarly, I also got myself an [AMEX Blue Business Plus](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/referral/prospect/business/8484B0951AE842879EA90498CD2E396B40C8ACA40308FBF73AD8900CBF5BDBCD42F5FB1476008E149B477A1DCD2A9ED9BF6418587E0B0821BB8DD7E0832876C8438A31A8FFB008E3D98220421E9C303BD4A986BB1FA627DC72D03D4357E3F5F9EFB729AE758F685BBF6B2E368A2593BC098AF5D44D2F355EA813891000E218CAB417EC141CBB82B0A37AD7990A8A803D78BAF41B14F48DB8132ADC2A44340A868046E9A7216F881D9989FDD830EF89D67239E6225311C54BEBC971BE5468645633E4B4EC978A7E0A58188A00528A7B2F8445CC3571D5D242?CORID=M~D~I~R~T~H~V~i~I~2-1737844314182-1907590564&GENCODE=349993292993082&extlink=US-MGM-USEFULLINKS-copypaste-1157-201279-K84O%3A9990&ref=MDIRTHViI2&v=2&xl=cp19) in December 2024, albeit with a higher sign up bonus. 

After spending $6,000 in the first 4 months, I will receive 25,000 Membership Rewards points. That’s somewhere between $500 and $750 in travel value.

I already had a [Blue Business Plus](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/referral/prospect/business/8484B0951AE842879EA90498CD2E396B40C8ACA40308FBF73AD8900CBF5BDBCD42F5FB1476008E149B477A1DCD2A9ED9BF6418587E0B0821BB8DD7E0832876C8438A31A8FFB008E3D98220421E9C303BD4A986BB1FA627DC72D03D4357E3F5F9EFB729AE758F685BBF6B2E368A2593BC098AF5D44D2F355EA813891000E218CAB417EC141CBB82B0A37AD7990A8A803D78BAF41B14F48DB8132ADC2A44340A868046E9A7216F881D9989FDD830EF89D67239E6225311C54BEBC971BE5468645633E4B4EC978A7E0A58188A00528A7B2F8445CC3571D5D242?CORID=M~D~I~R~T~H~V~i~I~2-1737844314182-1907590564&GENCODE=349993292993082&extlink=US-MGM-USEFULLINKS-copypaste-1157-201279-K84O%3A9990&ref=MDIRTHViI2&v=2&xl=cp19) (BBP), but this was a no-lifetime-language (NLL) target offer that I couldn’t turn down. I plan on canceling my old BBP, and making this one my new “catch-all” card. 

Once I receive the sign-up-bonus from my Fidelity Rewards card, I will start spending on the Blue Business Plus. 

Putting $6,000 purchases on the [BBP](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/referral/prospect/business/8484B0951AE842879EA90498CD2E396B40C8ACA40308FBF73AD8900CBF5BDBCD42F5FB1476008E149B477A1DCD2A9ED9BF6418587E0B0821BB8DD7E0832876C8438A31A8FFB008E3D98220421E9C303BD4A986BB1FA627DC72D03D4357E3F5F9EFB729AE758F685BBF6B2E368A2593BC098AF5D44D2F355EA813891000E218CAB417EC141CBB82B0A37AD7990A8A803D78BAF41B14F48DB8132ADC2A44340A868046E9A7216F881D9989FDD830EF89D67239E6225311C54BEBC971BE5468645633E4B4EC978A7E0A58188A00528A7B2F8445CC3571D5D242?CORID=M~D~I~R~T~H~V~i~I~2-1737844314182-1907590564&GENCODE=349993292993082&extlink=US-MGM-USEFULLINKS-copypaste-1157-201279-K84O%3A9990&ref=MDIRTHViI2&v=2&xl=cp19) will net me 37,000 MR points (valued between $740 to $1,110). That’s somewhere in the ballpark of 12% to 19% return on spend.

## Bilt Mastercard

The [Bilt card](https://bilt.page/r/1YFG-4S1F) wraps up my Q1’2025 credit card setup. 

The card gives me 1X on rent. No other card gives me points on rent, without a 2-3% credit card fee. 

To successfully receive the rent points, I need to put 5 transactions on [this card](https://bilt.page/r/1YFG-4S1F) every month. I can hit that without too much hassle. Every week, I have recurring donations set up to 2 different non-profit organizations.

So, [Bilt](https://bilt.page/r/1YFG-4S1F) ends up becoming my “rent+donation” card every month.
