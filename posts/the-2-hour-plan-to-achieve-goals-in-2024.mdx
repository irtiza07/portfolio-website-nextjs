Every year I set myself lofty goals, only to fall short at the end of the year. 

It’s the same every year — **lose weight, improve cardio, and grow a side business with >$10K monthly revenue.** Flipping through my annual planning journal, it’s obvious, whether I like to admit it or not. 

Instead of being upset at myself, I did some introspection at the start of 2024. Why does it happen so regularly? A couple of things stood out:

1. The lofty goals themselves can have a paralyzing effect on me.
2. Focusing on the goal, rather than creating a daily system to achieve it, makes me procrastinate often.
3. I overestimate what I can get done every day outside my full-time job.
4. I have an all-or-nothing mentality — either work 3+ hours on something daily, or it doesn’t count.
5. I underestimate what can be achieved through daily incremental effort. 

Keeping all these in mind, with a fresh perspective, I took another look at my 2024 annual plan.

Not to my surprise, I had the same **2 primary goals** for 2024, outside my full-time job. I will paraphrase them below:
1. Become healthy — lose weight, gym routine, improve cardio, learn kickboxing, etc.
2. Grow online presence — YouTube, Medium, Blog, etc.

To avoid going down the same road I did in 2021/2022/2023, here’s the plan for this year.

## Focus Less on Numbers
In most self-help books, people always talk about being **objective with goals.** There’s a famous quote that has always resonated with me:

> What gets measured gets managed. 

I have found this extremely accurate at my full-time job as an engineering manager. Through many process changes and optimization, I have reached a point where I am happy with both my personal and our team’s productivity. 

However, when I try to apply the same concept to my personal life, it **falls apart**.

Measuring my personal goal in objective terms would read something like:
- Lose 20 Pounds
- Gain 10 pounds of muscle mass
- Reduce body fat to 12%
- Grow YouTube subscribers to 50K
- Grow Medium following to 10K
- Grow Email Newsletter audience to 15K

Maybe some of these are possible, if I put in the effort. However, they sound daunting! They are tough to measure, and more importantly, they are mostly out of my sphere of control. 

Because of that, this year I am focusing more on systems and routines, than objective goals. To be more specific, I am focusing on **one system.**

## The 2-Hour Plan
I have been using this system for over 6 weeks now, and it has brought great results! 

It’s simple: **Every day I spent at least 2 hours combined on my 2 main goals of the year.**

The system enforces a **lower bound**. Sure, if I am **enjoying** the work, I can keep doing it, but I will have to put in the effort for at least 2 hours. 

Why 2 hours? Not 1 or 4? 

It’s not a magic number. The reasoning is quite straightforward. My first primary goal — **become healthy** — will require me to either go to the gym or go out for a run, both will take at least one hour. 

Similarly, to make any meaningful progress on filming a YouTube video, writing a blog post, or programming takes at least one hour. 

Then there’s the more practical aspect of things. After spending 8 hours on my full-time job, there are only so many hours I have left every weekday. 

It’s reasonable for me to squeeze in 2 extra hours — an hour workout and another doing some work. More than that, it can become impractical.

## Habit Stacking
Okay, so now that I know I will work 2 hours every day towards my personal goals, the next question is **when?** 

If I were to turn back the years, whenever I had a period of regularly going to the gym, it would always be late at night. Maybe that’s what my body is most comfortable with.

Instead of fighting this natural inclination, I am leaning towards it.

That means, my **one-hour workout block** will be at night — most likely around 9 PM every day.

Next, the **one-hour side hustle block**. This is where I want to use the power of **habit stacking.** The concept of habit stacking comes from James Clear’s *Atomic Habits.* It’s a powerful technique that builds new habits by leveraging existing ones. 

In other words, it involves pairing a new behavior with a current behavior. 

Following that logic, I want to pair my **workout session** with my **side hustle work session.** Currently, I spend one hour on my side hustles, which leads up to my workout session. But, I wouldn’t be surprised if flips on some days.

Regardless, the goal is to pair these two together, so that every day **I have a contiguous chunk of at least 2 hours that I am spending on my two primary goals of 2024.**
