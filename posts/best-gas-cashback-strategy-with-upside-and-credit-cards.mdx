Gas prices continue to fluctuate, making it more important than ever to maximize your savings at the pump. By combining the [Upside app](https://upside.app.link/MF5PZ) with the right credit cards and loyalty programs, you can create a powerful triple-dip strategy that puts real money back in your pocket.

## Maximizing Cashback with Upside

[Upside](https://upside.app.link/MF5PZ) offers a straightforward way to earn cashback on your gas purchases:

1. Link your preferred credit card to the app
2. Claim offers at participating gas stations
3. Pay with your linked card
4. Receive cashback within 3-5 days
5. Redeem your earnings for gift cards or direct deposit

The app typically offers between 5-25 cents off per gallon, which adds up quickly over time. The best part? This cashback is completely independent of any credit card rewards you earn on the same purchase.
