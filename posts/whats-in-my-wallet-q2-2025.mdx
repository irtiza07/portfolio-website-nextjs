Another quarter, another couple of sign up bonuses. 


Going into the second quarter of 2025, I knew that I will have higher than average spend for a few different reasons: 

- Medical Bills
- Moving to a new apartment
- Parents visiting ATL from overseas 


That's why I decided to sign up for 2 new credit cards with large sign up bonuses. Those 2 cards have become the primary cards of my setup, supplemented by two catch-all workhorses. 


Let's take a look.

## American Express Business Gold

During March, I signed up for a new [American Express Business Gold](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/businessgold-card?ref=MDIRTHHYSy&XLINK=MYCP) American Express Business Gold through a no-lifetime-langugage (NLL) offer that gives 200,000 Membership Reward (MR) points for $10K spend in 3 months. 


That's a lot of MR points! Valuing MR points at 2 cents-per-point (CPP), the offer alone gives me $4,000 in travel value. In other words, it's a 40% return on spend (ROS). 


At $10K, the spend is higher than I would have liked. However, 3 months of rent alongside the one-off expenses mentioned above, should be more than enough to meet the spending requirement. The plan was to put all my expenses on this one card until I meet the $10K spending requirement. 


I am happy to report - the 200K MR points just hit my account a few days ago! 


On top of the sign-up-bonus, the multipliers came in handy too - 4X on restaurants (highest category spend) and 4X on gas (second highest category spend).

## American Express Amazon Business Prime Card

The next sign-up-bonus card I signed up for this quarter was the [AMEX Amazon Business Prime Card](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/cobrand/MDIRTHKK7N?XLINK=MYCP). It gives me 5% on all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases. 


The card came with a sign-up-bonus of $400 after spending $4,000 in 3 months. I have until early August to complete the spending requirement. 


I typically go for travel reward cards only. However, given the high expenses months coming up, especially several Amazon purchases coming up for the new apartment, I felt like I could do with some cash (as opposed to travel points). 


The $400 in reward can cover large items, such as, our mattress, bed frame or dining table. 


Having completed the Business Gold sign-up-bonus, the plan is to put all my purchases on this card until I receive the $400 bonus. After that, most likely I will only use this card for my Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud expenses.

## American Express Blue Business Plus

The [AMEX Blue Business Plus (BPP)](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/bluebusinessplus-credit-card?ref=MDIRTHcyin&XLINK=MYCP) will give me 0% APR for 7 more months. 


Any large purchases that I feel I need some time to pay off (without dipping into my savings), I have been putting on this card. It's a flat 2X card, so whatever I purchase gives me 2 MR points. 


More often than not, large purchases that I put on this card will be non-category spend, so 2X is the maximum I could have earned any way.

## Capital One Venture X

Finally, one of my favorite card that's always in my wallet - the [Capital One Venture X](https://i.capitalone.com/G35be7pGf). 


I can hardly remember a quarter where the Venture X was not a part of my primary wallet. This quarter in particular it maintains it's position for a few key reasons. 

- Backup VISA when merchants don't take American Express
- 5X when booking flights for my upcoming work trip to San Francisco
- Any purchases that could benefit from Purchase / Return / Extended Warranty protections


For anyone traveling at least once a year, this is the one card I always recommend. 

## Bonus: Capital One Offers

If you are still with me, here's a bonus tip. 


Although it's not a credit card, Capital One Offers can help you earn Capital One Miles faster than most Capital One credit cards. The platform gives you crazy multipliers on some of the most popular brands, such as: 

- 12X on Expedia
- 30X on Udemy
- 15X on Lululemon
- 10X on Hilton
- 15X on Peet's Coffee 


Over the last 3 months, I have earned close to 14K Capital One Miles through these offers:

- 1.4K on JD Sports
- 5K on Apple 
- 1K on EZContacts
- 1K on Neiwai
- 2K on Amazfit
- 2K on Pretty Little Things
- 1.2K on Ashley Furnitures

## Wrapping Up

So, that's my wallet for Q2'2025: American Express Business Gold, American Express Amazon Business Prime, American Express Blue Business Plus, and finally, the Capital One Venture X.
