As a Mazda Miata MX5 owner with a modest 11-gallon tank that demands premium fuel, I've become somewhat obsessive about optimizing my gas rewards.

With fuel prices continuing to fluctuate, finding ways to save at the pump has become more important than ever.

BP's Earnify rewards program offers several avenues for savings, and when combined with the right credit cards, the benefits become even more substantial.

The key is knowing which gas credit cards to pair with loyalty programs for maximum return.

## Understanding BP's Earnify Rewards Program

BP recently rebranded their loyalty program to "Earnify" (formerly BPme Rewards). Here's what the program offers:

- **Amazon Prime Benefit**: 5 cents off per gallon for Amazon Prime members
- **Mobile App Discount**: Additional 5 cents off per gallon when paying through the Earnify mobile app
- **Points System**: Earn 1 point for every $1 spent on gas
- **Redemption Structure**: Every 800 points gets you 20 cents off per gallon for a one-time fill-up (points reset to zero after redemption)

## My Miata Math: Real Savings Breakdown

With my Mazda Miata MX5's 11-gallon tank requiring premium fuel, let's calculate my monthly savings:

- **Monthly Fill-ups**: 4 times
- **Amazon Prime + App Discount**: 10¢ off per gallon on each fill-up
- **Monthly Savings from Discounts**: 11 gallons × 10¢ × 4 fill-ups = $4.40/month

For points accumulation:
- Assuming premium gas at $4.50/gallon
- **Monthly Spend**: $4.50 × 11 gallons × 4 fill-ups = $198/month
- **Monthly Points Earned**: 198 points
- **Months to Reach 800 Points**: Approximately 4 months
- **Additional Savings Every 4 Months**: 11 gallons × 20¢ = $2.20 (or about $0.55/month when averaged)

**Total Monthly Savings**: $4.95 (not accounting for any credit card rewards)

## The Average American SUV Owner's Savings

For comparison, let's calculate savings for a typical American driving an SUV that requires premium fuel:

- **Average Tank Size**: 18 gallons
- **Monthly Fill-ups**: 4 times
- **Amazon Prime + App Discount**: 10¢ off per gallon on each fill-up
- **Monthly Savings from Discounts**: 18 gallons × 10¢ × 4 fill-ups = $7.20/month

For points accumulation:
- **Monthly Spend**: $4.50 × 18 gallons × 4 fill-ups = $324/month
- **Monthly Points Earned**: 324 points
- **Months to Reach 800 Points**: Approximately 2.5 months
- **Additional Savings Every 2.5 Months**: 18 gallons × 20¢ = $3.60 (or about $1.44/month when averaged)

**Total Monthly Savings**: $8.64 (before credit card rewards)
