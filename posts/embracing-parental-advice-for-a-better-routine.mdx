Wake up early. Get some sunlight early in the morning. Eat a good breakfast. Walk around, instead of slouching on your chair. Don’t snack too much. Cook and eat healthy. Exercise. Read. Work Hard.

Be greteful or pray or meditate or stay mindful, depending on what you believe in.

I still find these advice ringing in my ears. 

Growing up in a military family in Bangladesh, discipline was key. My loving parents tried their best to bring me up as a disciplined man of value. 

Today, I wish I could say that I resonate strongly with the advice above. I don’t. 

Instead, I remember them because growing up these were the bane of my existence. I ignored them, opting instead to game, play football, or even worse, scroll mindlessly on my phone. 

After some significant life changes in the past 2 years, these timeless advice are coming back to me. Having incorporated a few of these into my daily routine, I was instantly overwhelmed with regret. 

No, not because they changed my life for the worse, but because they have drastically improved my life for the better. 

Only if I listened to their advice, instead of putting my blindfolds on. 

Oh well, better late than never, I guess. 

In this blog post, I will discuss how I incorporated timeless advice from my parents into my **daily routine**, to make my days more **focused, productive and mindful.**

## Principles
There are 3 concepts or principles I want to outline, before listing our a literal timeline of how I plan on going about my day. 

1. Anchor Moments — Specific, regular events or activities that provide structure and stability to a routine
2. Intentional Mindfulness — Purposefully paying attention to the present moment and having an intention behind every action or activity
3. Working in Focus Blocks — Dedicate specific work blocks dedicated towards meetings, low-focus execution tasks or deep-focus longer horizon tasks

I have found **anchor moments** key to having a day that you can be proud of. 

These can be anything:
- Eating out vs cooking
- Going to the gym vs binge-watching a TV show
- Eating fast food vs healthy food
- Leaving your phone in your bedroom vs keeping it in personal all the time

The point is: these pivotal moments can act as anchors that will either catapult your day to success, or put you on a downward spiral of lazy mindless activities. 

By being **intentional** about these **anchor moments**, **mindfully** deciding what to do next, and working in **focus blocks** to differentiate between the different priorities of work, I plan on having a mindful, intentional and productive day. 

## Timeline — A Day in the Life
For a practicing Muslim such as myself, there’s nothing better than my **daily prayers** that can act as good anchor moments throughout the day. 

As Muslims, we are asked to pray 5 times a day during designated times from sunrise to after sunset.

Not only do **prayers** act as anchor moments, they are also great times for reflections, being grateful, and getting a broader perspective. It can almost recharge the rest of your day, when done with intention.

### Early Morning — 6AM to 9AM
- Start the day with **morning prayer** (or Fajr) 
- Spend 30-45 minutes **reading a book**
- Go out for **a walk** or to **the mosque** for some reflection
- 90-minutes of **deep work** towards programming, writing or creating content

### Morning — 9AM to 1PM
- Start **work day** as an engineering manager at Yelp
- Front load all team and other stakeholder **meetings**
- Spend 30-45 minutes on **low focus** Yelp work

### Noon — 1PM to 2PM
- Pray **Duhr prayer**
- Go to the **gym**

### Early Afternoon — 2PM to 4PM
- Take more **Yelp meetings**
- Do some higher-level **planning deep work** (when no meetings)

### Late Afternoon — 4PM to 6PM
- No meetings, only **focus Yelp work**
- Spend high quality focus time on **impactful priority Yelp work**
- Pray **Asr prayer**

### Evening — 6PM onwards
- **Cooking** or eating healthy
- Spending time with **friends and family**
- Pray **Maghrib prayer**

### Night — 10PM onwards
- Turn all the **screens off**
- Pray **Isha prayer**
- Start **sleep preparations**
