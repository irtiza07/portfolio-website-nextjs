In 2025, I earned 825,000 credit card reward points across 6 different programs through a combination of spend and new card bonuses, worth approximately $18,000 in travel value.

Generally, I consider myself to be quite a frugal individual. The fact that I could accumulate such a colossal amount of points is a testament to the various easy points earning mechanisms that are out there.

With high bonus category multipliers and extremely generous sign-up-bonuses, American Express Membership Rewards points takes the top crown, quickly followed by Citi ThankYou and Wells Fargo Rewards points (see breakdown table above).

I prefer earning such transferable currency over hotel or airline specific ones, but between Delta, Hilton and IHG, I always welcome earning points in a program that I can regularly put to good use.

## $18,000 in Estimated Travel Value
Everybody's travel habits demand a different point valuation. 

For some people, American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points might provide 1.2 cents-per-point (used on AMEX Travel), while for others it might provide 3-4 cents-per-point (redeemed for business class flights through transfer partners). 

There's no "one value to rule them all". Because of that, I have provided two different values - TPG's valuation and my personal valuation based on historical redemptions.
- Using TPG - $12,000
- Using Personal Redemptions - $18,000

The major difference is valuation of transferrable currencies (AMEX MR, Citi ThankYou, Wells Fargo Rewards). More often than not, I transfer them to Qatar Avios, Avianca LifeMiles and Flying Blue to redeem Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Delta / Air France, respectively, easily getting more than 3 cents-per-point (CPP) for business class flights. 

Hence, I value all transferable points at 3CPP. Your mileage may vary. 

When it comes to Delta SkyMiles, I value them slightly higher (1.2 vs 1.5 CPP) because I hold the AMEX Delta Gold credit card that automatically gives me 15% off all domestic award flights. Even with Delta's dynamic pricing, in one of my most frequency routes (ATL - SFO), I easily get 1.5 CPPs. 

Finally, hotel currencies - Hilton Honors and IHG Rewards. I usually take full advantage of 5th-night-free or 4th-night-free (respectively) benefits. Yet, I don't consistently get significantly more value that TPG. 

Recap - across these 6 programs, I have accumulated a massive 825K points, worth $18K according to my valuation (and $12K by TPG's). 
## Notable Credit Cards
They key to earning points so quickly is having a strategic core credit card setup that earns you the highest number of points on your highest spend categories (dining, grocery, gas, etc).

Here are a few notable ones from my setup:

## Closing Thoughts
All in all, 2025 was a great points-earning year. I have earned enough points to feed all my travels in 2026 and 2027. 

Next I will create a strategy for some big targeted redemptions in 2028, starting with a new core wallet setup for 2026.
