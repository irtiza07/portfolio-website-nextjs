[Ghost](https://ghost.org/pricing/) charged me **$174/month** to manage my **10,000 subscribers**.

[ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/pricing) used to charge me **$100/month** to manage the same **10,000 subscribers**.

Now, my self-hosted [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) costs me less than **$11/month** to manage **10,000 subscribers**.

For a small creator like myself, who does not make any revenue from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDankIVMXJEkhtjv5yLSN4g), [Medium](https://medium.com/@irtizahafiz), or his [website](https://irtizahafiz.com/), saving around $2,000/month is a big deal.

In this blog post, I will go over how I migrated from Ghost to Listmonk, how I hosted Listmonk on my server, and how I started sending my newsletters for free.

Here’s a quick lookahead:

If that looks interesting to you, let’s get started.

## Listmonk — Free, Open Source, Private!

![listmonk dashboard](/public/listmonk-dashboard.png)

[Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) is a self-hosted emailing newsletter and mailing list manager.

Two of its most important features to me are **open-source** and **private.** You own your data. When you self-host Listmonk, it uses a Postgres database out of the box that stores all user data.

Whether you want to manage a mailing list of subscribers or design and send out personalized email campaigns, you can do it all with Listmonk.

### Feature Set

Previously, I used both ConvertKit and Ghost as my mailing list manager. They were both expensive, but at the same time, their feature set was vast.

When I migrated to Listmonk, to my surprise, I found its features comparable to its more expensive counterparts.

Some notable highlights:

- Store custom JSON attribute per subscriber
- Both single and double opt-ins
- Design personalized templates
- Out-of-the-box API support for mailing list management as well as email campaigns
- Supports multiple “message” types — email, SMS, Whatsapp, etc
- User-friendly analytics dashboard
- Public customizable “subscribe” page
- Easy way to unsubscribe or wipe user data
- Email views and clicks tracking

For the majority of small creators, these features are more than enough to get started.

In my opinion, these will take you a long way — maybe even up to 100K subscribers — before you need a more complex (or expensive) solution.

If the feature set and price sound good to you, let me walk you through how I self-hosted Listmonk.

## Self-Hosting in a Digital Ocean Server for $11/month

If you visit https://newsletter.irtizahafiz.com, you will find my Listmonk instance.

I host my Listmonk instance on my Digital Ocean server, which is also home to my [personal website](https://irtizahafiz.com/) and [web analytics dashboard](https://umami.irtizahafiz.com/).

All of those (and more) cost me around $11/month.

### Docker Installation

I found that the easiest way to get started with a **production-ready** version of Listmonk is through Docker.

The [installation docs](https://listmonk.app/docs/installation/) does a great job walking you through the steps. With one bash script, you will get the following:

- Downloads necessary Listmonk Docker images and sets up containers
- Runs a Postgres database container and sets up required schemas
- Runs Listmonk admin UI, giving you full control locally

### Nginx Setup and Reverse Proxy

Once the docker container is up and running, you can access your Listmonk dashboard through your server’s port 9000.

So, if you go to http://localhost:9000, you can access your Listmonk dashboard.

However, I wanted to expose my instance to the **public internet** (of course behind a strong password). To do that, I used Nginx reverse proxy.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="perl" wrapLines="true">
  {`
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name newsletter.irtizahafiz.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
    }
    location = /api/public/subscription {
        if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'POST';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Content-Type';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000;
            add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
            add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
            return 204;
        }

        if ($request_method = 'POST') {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
        }

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
    }
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/irtizahafiz.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/irtizahafiz.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name newsletter.irtizahafiz.com; # Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
    if ($scheme != "https") {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

The above Nginx configuration does the following:

- Routes (or proxies) any HTTP or HTTPS request from newsletter.irtizahafiz.com to the server’s port 9000 (where Listmonk is running)
- Adds the relevant **CORS headers** to allow cross-origin requests so that my website’s client can make API requests to manage Listmonk mailing lists and newsletters
- Allows POST requests to create new subscribers (still requires AUTH headers)

With the above setup, I can do both:

- Access the Listmonk dashboard from the public internet to **create email campaigns**, **manage mailing lists**, and **check analytics**
- Access Listmonk’s **API** to programmatically interact with subscriber and campaign data

### SMTP Setup (with Gmail)

![Listmonk SMTP Configuration](/public/listmonk-smtp.png)

When it comes to sending emails out, Listmonk requires an **SMTP client**.

I could have used my personal domain’s SMTP, but it’s likely emails coming from my domain might be categorized as spam.

Instead, I chose a more reputable SMTP client — **Gmail**.

Through the Listmonk dashboard settings, it took me 2 minutes to link my business Gmail account. Now, all email campaigns Listmonk sends use my business Google email, and it’s FREE.

In the future, I plan on migrating from Gmail to Protonmail, but currently, Protonmail only supports SMTP in its business plan, which I don’t use.

### (Coming Up) Limit API Access using a Firewall

Given that Listmonk’s dashboard is very powerful, it’s sufficient for all my needs.

Because of that, the only use I make of its API is to add new subscribers. To be more specific, for https://irtizahafiz.com/newsletter to make POST requests to add new subscribers to my Listmonk’s Postgres database.

So, in the next couple of days, I plan on limiting API access to that route only. It only takes a few lines of Nginx code, but I am lazy.

## Closing Thoughts

If you have made it this far, I hope you found this valuable.
