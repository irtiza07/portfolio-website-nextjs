In the first 6 months of 2024, I saved a total of $3,712 by using credit card points, instead of spending my hard-earned cash. 

Toronto. Atlanta. Dhaka. Nashville. Chattanooga. 

I was able to travel to these 5 cities, either flying business class, or living comfortably in good hotels for *almost* free. 

It‚Äôs even more impressive to me this year compared to other years, given the high inflation and constant news of job losses. By having access to credit card points, I could keep traveling without any meaningful impact on my savings rate. 

In this blog post, I will tell you about each of my redeption story, points earning strategy, and the credit cards that made it possible. 

If that interests you, let‚Äôs get started.

## üè® Dhaka, Bangladesh
I stayed **4 nights** in IHG‚Äôs Crowne Plaza hotel by spending **51,000 IHG points**. 

A couple of years ago, I signed up for [Chase‚Äôs IHG Premier Card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/210m/1XJ2MVKHIH) with a sign up bonus of **140,000 IHG points**. 

Just by putting all my regular expenses on this credit card for 3 months, I was able to hit the spending requirements, and within a week the 140,000 points posted to my IHG account. 

The credit card also comes with IHG‚Äôs second highest elite status ‚Äî Platinum Elite. 

Because of the elevated status, we were upgraded to a higher floor room with a view, got 30% off all food purchases during our stay, and received dedicated conceirge support during our stay. It felt great! 

Let‚Äôs do some number crunching now. 

Cash Value = $567
IHG Points = 51,000
Cents-per-point (CPP) = 1.11 

In other words, if I had paid cash instead of using credit card points, my 4 nights hotel stay would have cost me **$567**. Instead, it cost me **$0**. 

## üõ´ Toronto to Atlanta
In the past few months, I had to fly between Toronto and Atlanta multiple times. 

Most of the times, I had to travel with 2 checked-in luggages and had to book my flights last-minute. 

This meant 2 things:
1. Extra luggage cost if I travelled Economy
2. Cash price of last-minute flights can be exorbitantly expensive (you will see soon)

If I added the luggage cost to my economy ticket, it was almost the same as booking business with credit card points. 

That‚Äôs why, I decided to fly business in both my flights to Atlanta. 

I took **2 business class flights** from Toronto to Atlanta by spending **62,800 Air Canada Aeroplan points**. 

I transferred over 62,800 American Express Membership Rewards points to Air Canada.

How did I earn so many points? Actually, it was quite easy. 

2 of my most used credit cards last year was ‚Äî [AMEX Gold](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/gold-card?ref=MDIRTHlsVP&XLINK=MYCP) and [AMEX Blue Business Plus](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/bluebusinessplus-credit-card?ref=MDIRTHTjpg&XLINK=MYCP). On top of that, I do most of my online shopping through [Rakuten](www.rakuten.com/r/JBNNVV?eeid=28187), which gives me MR points as well. 

All those combined, I earned more than 80,000 MR points last year. I transferred a subset of that to Air Canada Aeroplan. 

By flying business class, not only did I get complementary extra baggage, but also access to Toronto‚Äôs Maple airport lounges, priority check-in and priority security lanes. 

Let‚Äôs do some number crunching now. 

Cash Value = $750 + $797 = $1,547
Aeroplan Points = 23,800 + 39,000 = 62,800
Taxes paid with cash = $94 + $94 = $188
Cents-per-point (CPP) = 2.2

In other words, if I had paid cash instead of using credit card points, my 2 business class flights would have cost me **$1,547**. Instead, it cost me **$188 only**.

## üõ´ Atlanta to Toronto
Staying on the subject of flying between Atlanta and Toronto, I also used **13,200 Aeroplan points** to fly economy in Air Canada. 

Even though the experience was nothing crazy, this was one of my best ‚Äúvalue redemption‚Äù. 

Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers to see why that‚Äôs the case. 

Cash Value = $562
Aeroplan Points = 13,200
Taxes paid with cash = $60
Cents-per-point (CPP) = 3.80

That‚Äôs almost **4CPP**, which, in my humble opinion, is fantastic! 

If you have paid attention so far, you will also have noticed a few interesting things:
- Cash price difference between Economy and Business was only ~$200
- Cash prices are very high, given flight time is only around 2 hours

Okay, getting back to points redemption now, if I had paid cash instead of using credit card points, my economy flight would have cost me **$562**. Instead, it cost me **$60 only**.

## üè® Nashville
I stayed **3 nights** in Marriott‚Äôs Renaissance Nashville hotel by spending **3 Marriott Free Night Certificates**. 

Okay, let‚Äôs start with the definition of Free Night Certificates (FNCs). 

I was quite new to FNCs, until I signed up for [American Express‚Äôs Marriott Bonvoy Busines Card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/business/business-credit-cards/amex-marriott-bonvoy-business-credit-card/). As a sign up bonus, I was awarded 5 FNCs after I met the spending requirement. 

Each FNC was worth 50K points. 

That means, I could use 1 FNC for a hotel night that would cost me under 50K. So, I could use the same 1 FNC for both a 35K hotel night, or a 50K hotel night.

To maximize the value, you want to use your 5 FNCs on 5 nights, each costing exactly 50K. That‚Äôs how you get your *money‚Äôs worth*. However, you will soon see that might not be always possible. 

Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers to see why that‚Äôs the case. 

Cash Value for 3 Nights = $879
Marriott Bonvoy Points = 150,000 (3 FNC, each worth up to 50K points)
Taxes paid with cash = $94
Cents-per-point (CPP) = 0.52

You will see that my CPP is very low. That‚Äôs because I did not use my 50K certificates to their fullest potential. 

However, that‚Äôs for a good reason ‚Äî the hotel had the best location and amenties. If I picked a hotel to maximize my CPP, I would have to go out of my way and book a resort miles away from downtown Nashville, where we wanted to be. 

Because of that, we decided to accept the low CPP, in favor of better location and amenties. 

To bring things back to redemption, if I had paid cash instead of using credit card points, my 3 night hotel stay would have cost me **$859**. Instead, it cost me **$94 only**.

## üè® Chattanooga
Coming full circle, let‚Äôs see another redemption using IHG points. 

I stayed **1 night** in IHG‚Äôs Indigo hotel in Chattanooga, Tennessee  by spending **28,000** IHG points. 

On our way back from Nashville, we decided to spend one night in Chattanooga to soak in some beautiful river views, riverfront restaurants, and be in close proximity to northern Georgia mountains and the Great Smoky Mountains. 

If you remember the leftover 89,000 IHG points after my redemption in Dhaka, I used 28,000 from it for my hotel stay in Chattanooga. 

Let‚Äôs do another number crunching.

Cash Value for 1 night = $158
IHG Points = 28,000
Cents-per-point (CPP) = 0.56

You might complain looking at the low CPP, but IHG points are valued pretty lowly. 

As long as I get anywhere north of 0.5 CPP, I am happy with IHG points. 

Also, don‚Äôt forget, I earned all 140,000 IHG points through sign up bonus, so I didn‚Äôt really care too much about my redemption value, if I am being honest. 

To bring things back to redemption, if I had paid cash instead of using credit card points, my 1 night hotel stay would have cost me **$158**. Instead, it cost me **$0**.

## Closing Thoughts
Summing up everything, that‚Äôs **$3,712 worth of free travel only in the first 6 months of 2024.** 

If you have made it this far, I hope you found this valuable. 

The best way to support me is to use my referral credit card links that I sprinkled throughout this blog post. Just make sure it‚Äôs the best available offer for you.

I have already booked another **$2,000** worth of travel for the second half of 2024. Stay tuned for that.
