In 2024 I earned around 900K credit card points, worth around $11,000 by completing 9 sign-up-bonuses across 5 credit card issuers. 

Chasing sign-up-bonuses will always be the easiest way to earn lots of credit card points in the shortest possible time. 

To give you one example, say you want to accumulate 175K British/Qatar Avios to book round-trip USA/Asia flights in the famous QSuites. There are two ways you can gather these points: 

1. **Through credit card spending:** assume on average you earn 3X MR points per $1 spent. To earn 175K Avios, you must spend around $58,000. That’s a lot of money\!  
2. **Through sign-up-bonuses:** assume you sign up for 2 credit cards, one with a 75K bonus (Capital One Venture X) and one with a 100K bonus (American Express Gold). Combined, you spend $10,000 across 7 months to earn 175K Avios. 

Instead of spending $58,000, spending $10,000 towards sign-up-bonuses earns you the same 175,000 Avios. That’s \~83% less expenses\! 

Through that example, I hope you understand the power of sign-up-bonuses. This is why I chased sign-up-bonuses instead of focusing on multipliers last year. 

In this blog post, I will go over all my sign-up-bonuses (SUBs), give you the points total, and finally use [TPG’s points valuation](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/monthly-valuations/) to approximate the dollar amount.

## Earning $10,862 Through 9 SUBs in 2024

How much value one can get from 891K credit card points depend on their redemption strategies. It can be anywhere from $6,000 to over $20,000. 

For a reasonable valuation, I will use [TPG’s points valuation chart](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/monthly-valuations/).  

If you are interested to know how much value I got from some of these points, check out my [2024 redemptions blog post that I recently wrote.](https://irtizahafiz.com/blog/credit-cards-saved-me-$15,000-travel-expenses-in-2024)

That said, let’s look at a realistic value that you could get. 

1. 101.6K UR points \= 2.05 \* 101.6K \= $2,082  
2. 140K IHG points \= 0.5 \* 140K \= $700  
3. 250K Marriott points \= 0.7 \* 250K \= $1,750  
4. 220K Hilton points \= 0.6 \* 220K \= $1,320  
5. 175K MR points \= 2 \* 175K \= $3,500  
6. 10K Wells Fargo points \= 1.6 \* 10K \= $160  
7. 75K Citi ThankYou points \= 1.8 \* 75K \= $1,350

**Summing up, that’s an astounding $10,862.**

## Closing Thoughts

If I were to earn these 900K points through my regular spending, I would have had to spend around $300,000 (assuming I get 3 points per dollar). 

So, in 2024 I earned 900K credit card points worth around $11,000 in travel value by completing 9 sign-up-bonuses across American Express, Chase, Wells Fargo and Citi.
